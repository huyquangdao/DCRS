# Broadening the View: Demonstration-augmented Prompt Learning for Conversational Recommendation

This repo contains code and data for the paper: "Broadening the View: Demonstration-augmented Prompt
Learning for Conversational Recommendation".

## 1. Setup

Please install the libraries, and packages listed in the conv/requirements.txt file. Make sure that you are using CUDA 11.6. Otherwise, some unexpected behaviors might happen.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

You can download the processed data (including conv, rec, and retrieval data) from the following <a href = 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kEOn-lDQ9L5NgBhohg4Upwo9Kr4T01a6?usp=share_link'>link</a>.

For a fair comparison, we adopted the code from <a href='https://github.com/zxd-octopus/VRICR/tree/master'>VRICR</a> and <a href = 'https://github.com/wxl1999/UniCRS/tree/main'>UNICRS </a> to process data for the recommendation engine and dialogue module respectively. 

## 3. Training Retrieval Module:

We build our retrieval module based on <a href='https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SimCSE'>SimCSE </a>. First, you need to generate data which is utilized to train our retrieval model.
```
python gen_data_for_retrieval.py
```
To train our retrieval module, please run
```
cd retrieval
sh run_unsup_example.sh
```
To generate retrieval data, please run

```
python test.py
```

## 4. Training Response Generation Model

For the ReDial dataset, to train our response generation model, please run:

```
cd conv
sh scripts/train_conv_retrieval_redial.sh
```

To produce generated responses, please run the following command:

```
sh scripts/infer_retrieval.sh
```

## 5. Training Recommendation Engine

To train our recommendation engine, you need to first pre-train neural embeddings of demonstrations. 

```
cd rec
sh scripts/pretrain.sh
```

To finetune our recommendation engine, please following commands:

```
sh scripts/train_rec.sh
```
